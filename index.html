        <tr>
            <td>1.7.1</td>
            <td>Added a method to validate gender. The code was able to be heavily simplified by using 
            OR statements in the gender validation process, instead of using 4 if statements. The code 
            ran into a runtime error after the validation process was over, because the sub didn't end after 
            the validation, which rendered the validation process useless. After this small bug was fixed, 
            the gender validaation process was added fully.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.7.2</td>
            <td>Added a method to validate first name and last name. The code checked if 
            the field was blank, and if it was, sent a message box, and ended the sub. 
            I went back to the gender validation code, and it caused a runtime error when the 
            field was completely blank. A work in progress to fix this problem where it crashes when 
            the gender is left blank.</td>
